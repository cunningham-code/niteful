# A Word On Flutter And Dart
Flutter is based on Dart, and Dart isn't like any programming language you have used before. It is far from Swift, a language that tries to be familiar with its similarities to Python.

Flutter makes a strange bet, a bet I would have never believed: the best way to make a UI is via text.
I started my interest in development with drag and drop website makers. I found refuge in Android and iOS's drag and drop scaffolding, but Flutter's UX modularity and color palette requirements ultimately make it a better tool.
